# 1 overview
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.


## 1.1 current problem 1
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

## 1.2 current problem 2
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 

# 2 improvement 
PubLayNet is a large dataset of document images, of which the layout is annotated with both bounding boxes and polygonal segmentations. 
The source of the documents is PubMed Central Open Access Subset (commercial use collection). 

|name|gender|age|
|:--:|:---:|:---:|
|alice|female|20|
|bob|male|21|
|charles|male|20|

The annotations are automatically generated by matching the PDF format and the XML format of the articles in the PubMed Central Open Access Subset. 
More details are available in our paper "PubLayNet: largest dataset ever for document layout analysis.".

## 2.1 method 1
DOCX files are complex, and their complexity makes scraping documents for their content difficult. The aim of this package is to simplify .docx files to just the components which carry meaning, thereby easing the process of pattern matching and data extraction by converting a .docx file into a predictable and human readable JSON file.
