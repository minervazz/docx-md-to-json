            "content": "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.\nThe point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.\nVarious versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."

The aim of this package is to simplify .docx files to just the components which carry meaning, thereby easing the process of pattern matching and data extraction by converting a .docx file into a predictable and human readable JSON file.\nSimplifying a complex document down to it's meaningful parts of course requires taking a position on what does and does-not convey meaning in a document. Generally, this package takes the stance that the document structure (body, paragraphs, tables, etc.) are meaningful as is the text itself, whereas text styling (font, font-weight, etc.) is ignored almost entirely, with the exception of paragraph indentation and numbering which is often used to create lists, block quotes, etc. Furthermore, the opinions expressed by this package are explained in the Options section below and can be changed to suite your needs.",
